# Week 7B: More DP

Today:

For today, focus on these and then the chosen problems

We did LCS (Longest Common Subsequence) last time, fill out the DP table (a matrix with ith row and jth column being dp[i][j]) by hand for the following example, and try to understand what each number in the table means
S = ABAZDC
T = BACBAD
 	
The recursion for LCS can be found here.

Do problems below, focus on finding the recurrence relation for each problem before starting to code. So for each problem:
Define your subproblems
Come up with recurrence relation
Specify the base cases


Problem A
[Range Sum Query 1D](leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-immutable)

Problem B  
[Partial Equal Subset Sum](leetcode.com/problems/partition-equal-subset-sum)

Problem C  
[Continuous Subarray Sum](leetcode.com/problems/continuous-subarray-sum) 

Problem D  
[Range Sum Query 2D](leetcode.com/problems/range-sum-query-2d-immutable)
